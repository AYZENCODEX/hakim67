 * lib/workflow/scheduler-handler.ts
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * AYZEN Mega Engine — Phase 8 blueprint, Part C2 (§24 + §34). The other
 * half of scheduler-integration.ts: registers the actual
 * `"workflow.resume"` job handler (§34's own named
 * `workflowResumeHandler`) against the scheduler's job-registry.ts.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT self-registered at module import time, unlike every
 * other registerX() call in this codebase's event-bus/scheduler modules
 * (event-registry.ts's DEFAULT_EVENT_TYPES, etc.) — a workflow run's
 * `ctx.authorize()` capability (§22, actions.ts) needs a real
 * `WorkflowAuthorizingEngine` + `WorkflowSubjectResolver` the app has
 * already assembled (a `PolicyEngine` with its rules registered, a
 * `DrizzleSubjectProvider` composed with a fresh `users` row fetch — see
 * authorization.ts's own header), and nothing in this codebase
 * constructs those yet, same "engine, not endpoint" / "ready to be
 * wired up by a future phase" posture every `lib/policy/pip/*` provider
 * and `lib/policy/pep/*` middleware already documents about itself.
 * `registerWorkflowResumeHandler()` is that future wiring point: the
 * app's own boot code (Part D / AyzenMegaEngine.start(), §36) calls it
 * once with whatever `WorkflowRuntimeEnv` it has actually assembled.
