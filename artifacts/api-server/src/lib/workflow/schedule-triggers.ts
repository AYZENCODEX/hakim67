 * lib/workflow/schedule-triggers.ts
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * AYZEN Mega Engine — Phase 8 blueprint, Part D2: Workflow ↔ Scheduler
 * (§23 "Schedule" + "Delayed" trigger kinds — the second item of Part
 * D's integration list, §57-D, right after D1's Event Bus ↔ Workflow).
 *
 * triggers.ts's own header called these two out as "Part B's scheduler
 * concern (a cron/delayed job whose handler starts a run — not yet
 * registered as of D1, tracked separately)". This file is that tracked-
 * separately piece. Same boot-time-snapshot posture as D1's
 * registerWorkflowEventTriggers(): a workflow_definition row changing
 * doesn't push a live update into either the scheduler's job table or
 * the event bus's in-memory subscription registry, so both registrars
 * below are meant to be called once at boot (or again, deliberately,
 * after a new/changed definition is published) — see triggers.ts's own
 * header for the full "why boot-time, not reactive" reasoning, which
 * applies here unchanged.
 *
 * ── Schedule trigger (§23 "every 30 minutes") ─────────────────────────────
 * Reduces directly to scheduler/job-store.ts's own scheduleCron(): one
 * recurring job per schedule-triggered definition, whose handler is a
 * *fixed* dispatcher (WORKFLOW_SCHEDULE_TRIGGER_JOB_TYPE) that starts a
 * fresh run of whichever `workflowId` is in the job's own payload — the
 * same "one handler, N payload-carried targets" shape triggers.ts uses
 * for "one event-bus consumer, N fanned-out workflows", just inverted
 * (there it's one dispatch fanning out to many; here each recurring job
 * IS already scoped to exactly one workflow, so no fan-out loop is
 * needed — a cron job's `correlationId` carries the workflowId 1:1).
 *
 * Re-registering on every boot needs an explicit dedupe guard that D1's
 * event-trigger registrar didn't: subscribe() is naturally idempotent
 * per (eventType, consumer) (see subscriptions.ts), but scheduleCron()
 * is NOT idempotent — it inserts a brand-new row every call. Without
 * scheduler/job-store.ts's hasActiveJobForCorrelation() guard below, a
 * process restarted daily would accumulate a new duplicate recurring
 * job every single day for the same workflow.
 *
 * ── Delayed trigger (§23 "run 24 hours after event") ──────────────────────
 * Genuinely a composite of D1 + this file's own schedule half: it LISTENS
 * for `relativeToEventType` on the Event Bus (same subscribe()-per-
 * eventType, fan-out-to-N-workflows shape as triggers.ts) and, on each
 * matching event, schedules a ONE-TIME job `afterMs` out (scheduler/
 * job-store.ts's scheduleDelayed()) rather than starting the run
 * immediately — the run itself only actually starts later, when that
 * delayed job comes due, via the exact same WORKFLOW_DELAYED_TRIGGER_JOB_TYPE
 * handler pattern the schedule half uses. The triggering event's
 * userId/organizationId/correlationId ride along in the job's payload so
 * the eventually-started run's WorkflowContext still reflects who/what
 * caused it (§19), same fields triggers.ts already copies for the
 * immediate "event" trigger kind.
 *
 * A `{ kind: "delayed" }` trigger with no `relativeToEventType` has no
 * anchor to measure `afterMs` from — §23's own example ("24 hours AFTER
 * EVENT") presumes one. Rather than guessing an anchor (boot time? first
 * observation?), this registrar logs and skips those definitions, the
 * same fail-closed-and-say-so posture scheduler-handler.ts's own header
 * documents for a WorkflowRuntimeEnv that can't authorize anything yet.

/**
 * §26-adjacent guard, same shape as triggers.ts's own `startedForEvent`
 * set (see that file's header for the full reasoning) — keyed on
 * (eventId, workflowId) so a redelivered anchor event doesn't schedule a
 * second delayed job for the same (event, workflow) pair within THIS
 * process's lifetime. Process-local only — the durable, cross-restart
 * backstop is Part H3 (migration 115)'s
 * scheduled_job_delayed_trigger_causation_idx, a partial UNIQUE index on
 * `scheduled_job (causation_id, payload->>'workflowId')` scoped to
 * job_type = 'workflow.trigger.delayed'. That migration's own header
 * explains why the key is (causation_id, payload->>'workflowId') and not
 * (job_type, causation_id) alone (one anchor event can legitimately fan
 * out to several different target workflows sharing this job_type), and
 * why job-store.ts's scheduleJob()/scheduleDelayed() deliberately do NOT
 * catch that violation themselves the way run-store.ts's startRun() (H1)
 * catches workflow_run's sibling constraint: job-store.ts's own columns
 * can't disambiguate which of several same-(jobType, causationId) rows a
 * generic `(jobType, causationId)` lookup would even mean, without
 * reaching into a payload shape that isn't job-store.ts's to know. This
 * file IS the place that knows: it supplies both halves of the key
 * itself (`causationId: envelope.id`, `payload.workflowId`), so the
 * catch block in the loop below is where the 23505 from that index gets
 * recognized and treated as the benign "already scheduled" outcome it
 * actually is, rather than a real scheduling failure. Nothing here reads
 * the winning row's id back — neither this file nor
 * registerWorkflowTriggerJobHandlers()'s dispatch handler above needs
 * the specific job id, only that a job for (event, workflow) exists —
 * so there is no run-store.ts-style re-select; the duplicate-handling
 * this function needs is entirely "swallow it, log it as expected,
 * move on".
