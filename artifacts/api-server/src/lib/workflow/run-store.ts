 * AYZEN Mega Engine — Phase 8 blueprint, Part C1: Workflow durable core
 * (§17 State Machine, §18 Durable State, §26 Idempotency). The write/read
 * side of a run — same split scheduler/job-store.ts draws for jobs
 * (this file owns getting a run onto, and off of, the table; the actual
 * step-by-step execution loop that dispatches actions and evaluates
 * conditions is Part C2's engine.ts, same way worker.ts is scheduler's
 * separate execution half).
 *
 * startRun(params, tx) takes the same optional transaction handle
 * publisher.ts's publishEvent() and scheduler/job-store.ts's scheduleJob()
 * do, for the same reason: a run is very often started as a direct
 * consequence of a business write or an event handler, and should land
 * durably in the same commit as whatever triggered it.
