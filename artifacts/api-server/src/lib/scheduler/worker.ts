/**
 * lib/scheduler/worker.ts
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * §30 Scheduler Execution / §33 Worker Pool (Part B1), extended in Part B2
 * with §29 Recurring/Cron + §31 Misfire Handling (see dispatchRecurringJob()
 * below). Claim/lease/backoff shape is the same pattern as
 * event-bus/dispatcher.ts and lib/mail-send-queue.ts (`FOR UPDATE SKIP
 * LOCKED` claim, lease expiry instead of a fixed stuck-timeout constant —
 * see below, jittered exponential backoff via scheduler/retry.ts) — third
 * instance of the same idiom in this codebase now, deliberately not a
 * fourth-different one.
 *
 * §30's lease model: `locked_until` (an absolute expiry instant, not a
 * "locked since" timestamp + fixed recovery window like event_outbox
 * uses) + `locked_by` + `heartbeat_at`. Set once at claim time, generous
 * enough to cover a slow handler (JOB_LEASE_DURATION_MS below); it does
 * not renew the lease mid-execution for a still-running handler (a true
 * heartbeat-extends-lease loop is more machinery than any job scheduled so
 * far needs). `heartbeat_at` is still stamped at claim time so the column
 * has real data for whenever a future job type's handler does need it,
 * per §30/§33's shape, without having to guess the extension protocol
 * prematurely (§56).
 *
 * §33's six worker responsibilities, in dispatchJob()/dispatchRecurringJob()
 * below:
 *   1. claim job          -> claimNextBatch()
 *   2. validate payload    -> (no per-job-type schema yet — same
 *                              "registry SUPPORTS validation, not every
 *                              type has one on day one" posture as
 *                              event-registry.ts)
 *   3. execute handler      -> job-registry.ts's registered handler
 *   4. emit completion/failure event -> publishEvent("scheduler.job.completed" | "scheduler.job.failed", tx) — §35
 *   5. update job state       -> COMPLETED/DEAD_LETTER (one-time) or re-armed SCHEDULED (recurring/cron, B2) / RETRYING+backoff, in the SAME tx as #4
 *   6. release/expire lease     -> cleared on every terminal/retry write; a crashed worker's lease simply expires (see recoverExpiredLeases())

 *   - succeeds -> re-armed SCHEDULED at the next occurrence, attempts
 *     reset to 0 (§28's `attempts` is scoped to "retries of the CURRENT
 *     due occurrence", not a lifetime counter across occurrences — a
 *     transient failure on Tuesday's run shouldn't count against
 *     Wednesday's),
 *   - fails but hasn't exhausted max_attempts -> RETRYING with backoff,
 *     same as a one-time job (retry.ts's nextAttemptDelayMs()), or

 *     but the row itself is STILL re-armed for its next occurrence rather
 *     than terminating. A single bad run can never permanently kill a
 *     recurring schedule — only cancelJob() (B1, unchanged) does that.
 *
 * §31's misfire policy is resolved once per dispatch, against the row's
 * own (possibly overdue) `run_at` as the "due since" reference point —
 * see misfire.ts's resolveMisfire(). Under CATCH_UP, multiple occurrences
 * run sequentially inside this same job dispatch; if any one of them throws, the
 * remaining ones in that batch are NOT attempted (the whole dispatch is
 * treated as one failed attempt and retried/backed-off as a unit, same as
 * a single-occurrence failure would be) — simpler and safer than trying
 * to track partial-batch completion across retries.
