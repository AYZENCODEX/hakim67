/**
 * lib/mega-engine/retention.ts
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * AYZEN Mega Engine — Phase 8 blueprint, Part E3 (§57-E's last two
 * bullets, "cleanup" + "retention" — the two items E1
 * (`CHANGES_MEGA_ENGINE_OBSERVABILITY_PHASE_E1.md`) and E2
 * (`CHANGES_MEGA_ENGINE_ADMIN_INSPECTION_PHASE_E2.md`) both carried
 * forward in their own "Still open" lists). Implements §60's own table:
 *
 *   event_outbox      -> short operational retention
 *   event_processing  -> compact retention
 *   dead_letter       -> longer operational retention
 *   workflow_run      -> configurable business retention
 *   scheduler attempts -> short operational retention
 *   audit             -> governed by existing audit policy (NOT touched
 *                         here — §60's own closing line: "Do not delete
 *                         audit records merely because event records
 *                         expire.")
 *
 * "dead_letter" above covers BOTH `event_dead_letter` (Part A) and
 * `scheduled_job_dead_letter` (Part B1) — the two engines' DLQ tables
 * are the same shape of thing (§57-E groups them as one bullet, and
 * engine-health.ts's own `checkEventBusDlq()`/`checkSchedulerDlq()`
 * already treat them as parallel signals).
 *
 * §60 lists six rows; this file targets five of them (everything except
 * `audit`, deliberately left alone). `scheduled_job` itself (the job
 * record, as opposed to its `scheduled_job_attempt` log rows) has no
 * §60 entry of its own — unlike `workflow_run`'s explicit "configurable
 * business retention", nothing in the blueprint says a completed
 * one-time job's row should ever be deleted, and a job row (e.g. "sent
 * this user their 30-minute reminder") can matter for the same kind of
 * business-record reasons a workflow_run does. Left alone here rather
 * than guessing a window for it — see this file's own closing "Still
 * open" note in the phase's CHANGES doc.
 *
 * Every window below is a fixed constant, not yet wired to §53
 * Configuration (no `RETENTION_*` env var exists in that section's own
 * list) — same "deliberately coarse V1, start simple" posture
 * engine-health.ts's own thresholds already document for themselves.
 * `workflow_run`'s window says "configurable" in §60 itself; until a
 * real config knob exists, `WORKFLOW_RUN_RETENTION_MS` below is that
 * knob's V1 placeholder, not a permanent hardcode.
 *
 * Cleanup is deliberately batched. A retention job must not hold a lock for
 * the entire operational history or compete with the live engines.
